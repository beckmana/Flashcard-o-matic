/*
The Edit Card screen has the following features:

    - The path to this screen should include the deckId and the cardId (i.e., /decks/:deckId/cards/:cardId/edit).

    - There is a breadcrumb navigation bar with a link to home /, followed by the name of the deck of which the edited card is a member, and finally the text Edit Card :cardId (e.g., Home/Deck React Router/Edit Card 4).

    * It displays the same form as the Add Card screen, except it is pre-filled with information for the existing card. It can be edited and updated.

    - If the user clicks on either "Save" or "Cancel", the user is taken to the Deck screen.
