 The Edit Deck screen has the following features:

    - The path to this screen should include the deckId(i.e., /decks/:deckId/edit).

    - There is a breadcrumb navigation bar with a link to home /, followed by the name of the deck being edited, and finally the text Edit Deck (e.g., Home/Rendering in React/Edit Deck).

    * It displays the same form as the Create Deck screen, except it is pre-filled with information for the existing deck. The user can edit and update the form.

    - If the user clicks "Cancel", the user is taken to the Deck screen.
